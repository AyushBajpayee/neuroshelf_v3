Ideas
1) Memory that changes behavior over time
You have agent_decisions logs — but are agents actually learning from past promotion outcomes?
 A truly agentic system would notice "every time we ran a 20% discount on SKU #7 in Store 3 on rainy days, it underperformed" and bake that in without a human telling it to. Utilise the agent_decisions data to retrain
 
2) The coupon design itself as an agent problem
This one's interesting for your use case specifically — instead of designing a promotion, what if the agent negotiated the coupon? Like, it starts with a conservative offer, simulates expected sell-through, escalates discount incrementally until it hits a margin floor. More autonomous, more interesting edge cases.

3) The approval queue as a learning signal, not a bottleneck
Right now manual approval is binary: approve or reject. What if rejections fed back into the agent as a labeled example — "a human said no to this because X" — and the agent adjusted its future proposals accordingly? This also comes similar to point 1

4) Introduce internal debate / multi-perspective reasoning
Currently the flow is linear.
Agentic systems often feel more “alive” when there’s tension.

You could simulate roles like:

Profit Guardian (margin protection)
Growth Hacker (revenue maximization)
Brand Guardian (avoid over-discounting)

They argue → final decision emerges.

Why this helps:

Produces richer rationales
Makes behavior less deterministic
Surfaces tradeoffs explicitly

Value to the customer

1) Right now, your promotions are designed by humans looking at last week's data. This system designs them in real-time, looking at what's happening right now — and it doesn't sleep.

2) Where money is actually leaking in retail promotions today:

Discounts that were too deep (margin left on the table)
Discounts that were too shallow (inventory didn't move, markdown came later anyway)
Promos that launched at the wrong moment — weather tanked, competitor already ran the same deal
One-size-fits-all coupons across stores that have completely different customer behavior

Your system can attack all four simultaneously. That's hard to do with a human team.

3) Dynamic rule engine - Beats traditionally designed promotion rule engine's since it is always adaptive
